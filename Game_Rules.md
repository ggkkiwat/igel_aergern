# Game Rules for Igel Ärgern

"Igel Ärgern", translated as "Hedgehogs in a Hurry", is a delightful board game that combines elements of luck and strategy. The goal of the game is to be the first to move all your hedgehog pieces to the end of the board.

## Game Setup

- The game board consists of a 6x9 grid.
- Each player chooses a color and gets corresponding hedgehog pieces.
- Players place their hedgehogs at the start of the board during the setup phase.

## How to Play

### Starting the Game

- Players take turns in a clockwise direction.
- Each turn consists of two main actions: rolling a die and moving a hedgehog.

### Rolling the Die

- Players roll a six-sided die to determine their move.
- The number rolled dictates which row a player can interact with during their turn.

### Moving Hedgehogs

- **Forward Movement:** Players must move one of their hedgehogs in the row corresponding to the die roll one column forward.
- **Sideways Movement:** Before the forward move, players have the option to move any one hedgehog in any row one column sideways.
  - A hedgehog can be moved sideways into an adjacent column if and only if that column in the same row is not already occupied by another hedgehog.
  - Sideways movement is optional and can be skipped.

### Winning the Game

- The first player to move all their hedgehogs to the last column of the board wins.
- The game ends immediately when a player achieves this.

## Special Rules

- **Stacking:** Multiple hedgehogs can occupy the same square, creating a stack. Only the top hedgehog in a stack can be moved.
- **Blocked Movement:** If a row corresponding to the die roll has no hedgehogs that can be moved forward (because they are blocked by other hedgehogs), the player's turn is skipped.

## Strategy Tips

- Plan your moves to not only advance your hedgehogs but also to block your opponents.
- Keep an eye on the hedgehogs that are leading and strategize to either advance yours or block others.
- Remember, luck plays a part, but strategic movement can greatly increase your chances of winning.
