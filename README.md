# Igel Ärgern

This repository contains a Python implementation of the popular German board game "Igel Ärgern". The game, whose name translates to "Hedgehogs in a Hurry", is a fun, strategic game for multiple players. This implementation allows you to play the game in a text-based format on your computer.

## Game Overview

"Igel Ärgern" is a board game involving both luck and strategy. Players race their hedgehog pieces across a grid, aiming to be the first to get their pieces to the end. The game combines elements of chance (with dice rolls) and strategic thinking (as players choose which pieces to move).

   git clone https://github.com/ggkkiwat/igel_aergern.git
   cd igel_aergern
   ```

2. **Run the Game:**
